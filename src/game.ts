/**
 * This class is part of the "Zorld of Wuul" application. 
 * "Zorld of Wuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 * 
 * Users can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be 
 * extended to make it more interesting!
 * 
 * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 * method.
 * 
 * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 * rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 * executes the commands that the parser returns.
